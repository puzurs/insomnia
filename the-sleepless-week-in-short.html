      <h2 class="heading-general">The Insomnia: The Sleepless Week in Short</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-general">Out of 100 wannabes, the qualification determines nine men and nine women – 18 the lucky (or damned?) ones to compete in the <strong>Insomnia: the Sleepless Week</strong> race that takes place two months after qualification, at the end of June. <br><br>18 best ones are raffled in six teams, three participants of both sexes per team. Each team has a car. At the start, each team receives a task. Having completed its team receives the next one. Tasks include physical as well as mental, social and logical challenges and they mostly are located not more than 100 kilometres one from other. <br><br>By completing tasks teams move along the predefined route of the race towards the finish line several hundred kilometres away. Route of the race is predefined for the most part. There are possibilities to improvise and there are decisions to make but mostly there are known spots for tasks and moving between them. <br><br>The car is teams „base” that carries out most part of teams transportation but still, there are other means of transportation present like bicycle and boat.  <br><br>The catch? During whole week there`s no time reserved for sleep. Yes, not at all. Special measures are taken to make sure the driver of the car has slept enough and is able to drive safely but in general – participants have to manage their rest by themselves. To try to be a superhero and to fail in tasks or to have some sleep and maintain your skills throughout the whole week – that`s the question. The art of keeping the balance between the rest and the action is what we – organizers – aim for. <br><br>Results of all the tasks are measured in time. Time is the substance to fight about. Less time spent in tasks takes the team closer to victory. Nevertheless, due to nuances in rules, the first team to cross the finish line not necessarily turns out to be the winner of the race. The winner is known for sure only after the last team reaches the finish. <br><br>Teams don`t know the location of each other so the only way to victory is to be the fastest both in sleep and in tasks. Any of the three members of the team can be a driver. There are tasks separated for driver and for two other members of the team and there are tasks for all the team together. <br><br>Along with car team receives a smartphone with the competition app installed. Teams receive their tasks in-app by entering codes. Distance time of the team is measured by the time of the code entered. <br><br>Qualification has quite high application fee but the race itself for the 18 lucky ones is completely free of charge with all expenses covered and teams car provided by organisers, and there`s a cash Grand Prix for the winning team. <br><br>The qualification and the race are filmed and documentary TV series will be made after the race. The film crew doesn&#x27;t intervene the race in any way but the presence of cameras is one of the mental challenges mentioned above. <br><br>As far as we know, this is a race of an unprecedented concept. You might recall several shows seen on TV that are similar but there`s nothing like <strong>Insomnia: the Sleepless Week</strong>. <br><br>More details to follow.</p><a href="index.html" class="button-2 w-button">Home</a></div>
